# Americano

Express is an awesome tool to build small web application. But once you start
using it, you discover that writing the configuration and the routes
often leads to ugly code. To solve that, Americano acts as a
wrapper around Express and make it more opiniated about how to write routes
and configuration. See in the following how it make things cleaner.

## Configuration

*work in progress...*

## Routes

*work in progress...*

## Directory structure

*work in progress...*

## Plugins

*work in progress...*

## What about contributions?

Here is what I would like to do next:

* make a binary that would make scaffolding for Americano (wrapper for 
  scaffolt?)
* make a plugin for mongoose and facilitate its integration.

I didn't start any development yet, so you're welcome to participate!
