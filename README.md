# Americano

Express is an awesome tool to build small web application but when you start
with it writing your routes and
configuration often lead to an ugly code. To solve that, Americano acts as
wrapper around Express and make it more opiniated about how to write routes
and configuration. See in the following what does that mean.

## Configuration

*work in progress...*

## Routes

*work in progress...*

## Directory structure

*work in progress...*

## Plugins

*work in progress...*

## What about contributions?

Here is what I would like to do next:

* make a binary that would make scaffolding for Americano (wrapper for 
  scaffolt?)
* make a plugin for mongoose and facilitate its integration.

I didn't start any development yet, so you're welcome to participate!
